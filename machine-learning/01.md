# Machine learning - 01
> Learning Objectives:
> - To ensure you are prepared to complete all the modules
> - Get familiar with Google Colab
> - Understand the philosophy behind machine learning
## Prework and Prerequisites
Please read through the following contents before beginning.
- https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/prereqs-and-prework

## Programming Environment
In this training, we'll use Colab as a programming environment. [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/#scrollTo=GJBs_flRovLc) is Google's version of Jupyter Notebook.
- In this youtube tutorial you will discover all the basics you need to know to get started with Google Colab: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLYoEyIHL6A
- To complete this training, you are required to submit your colab notebooks for programming exercises. We prepared a guide for you: guide-on-how-to-submit-colab-notebook.pdf
